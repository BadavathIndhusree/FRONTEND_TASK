    <p>Cats only mate when the queen is "in heat". Heat periods occur about
         every two weeks and last 4 to 6 days.[21] Mating in cats is a spectacular 
         event. Several toms may be attracted to a [queen] in heat.
          The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. 
          At first, the female will reject the male, but eventually the female
           will allow the male to mate. The female will utter a loud yowl as the
            male pulls out of her.</p>

    <p>The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated 
        dog were discovered in Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany. Contextual, isotopic,
         genetic, and morphological evidence shows that this dog was not a local wolf.
         The dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried along with a man
          and a woman, all three having been sprayed with red hematite powder and buried
           under large, thick basalt blocks. The dog had died of canine distemper.
